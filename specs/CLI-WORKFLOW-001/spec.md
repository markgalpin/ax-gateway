# CLI-WORKFLOW-001: Smart Workflow Flags on Existing Commands

**Status:** Draft  
**Owner:** @backend_sentinel  
**Date:** 2026-04-13  
**Related:** CLI-DOCS-007 (Command Reference), ATTACHMENT-FLOW-001, LISTENER-001, skills/SKILL.md

## Summary

Replace preset orchestration verbs (`assign`, `ship`, `manage`, `boss`) with a
small set of composable flags on commands that already exist.

The proposed workflow surface is:

- `--notify [@agent] ["optional message"]`
- `--wait`
- `--assign @agent` (task commands only)

This keeps the CLI primitive-first. Users continue to run `ax context set`,
`ax upload file`, `ax task create`, and similar commands directly, then opt into
follow-up coordination with flags when they want it.

## Why

The current preset verbs package opinionated supervision loops into separate
commands. That creates three problems:

1. Users have to learn new verbs instead of extending the primitives they
   already know.
2. The preset names encode tone and policy (`boss`, `ship`) rather than a
   reusable execution model.
3. The docs drift toward orchestration recipes instead of a clear command
   reference.

The smart-flag model makes the workflow obvious:

- do the thing
- optionally notify someone about the result
- optionally wait for their response

The current implemented attention flag is `--mention @agent` on primary commands
that already emit or can emit a message signal. The command performs the primary
API action first, then writes the `@agent` tag into the message content so
message routing and mention-based listeners can wake the right agent.

When ownership or response evidence matters, those steps should be exposed as a
single composed operator action. The current production shape is `ax handoff`:
create or track the task, send the targeted message, wait on the control
channel, and return the reply/evidence in one result. Future `--assign`,
`--notify`, and `--wait` flags should preserve that same composition instead of
making operators hand-roll each primitive.

The mesh model is bidirectional by default: agents listen for inbound work and
use composed handoffs for outbound owned work. Sending and listening should be
part of the runtime posture, not an optional afterthought that each operator has
to remember.

For iterative work, the CLI should let an operator ask an agent and wait again
instead of stopping to ask the human. The implemented form is `ax handoff
... --loop`, inspired by Anthropic's Ralph Wiggum plugin. The aX version keeps
the loop explicit and bounded: task, message, SSE wait, threaded continuation,
structured result, and max-round/promise escape hatches.

## Goals

- No new top-level verbs for orchestration.
- Make common multi-step handoffs expressible from existing commands.
- Automatically carry forward relevant metadata from the completed operation.
- Keep output machine-readable and scriptable.
- Document common compositions as workflows, not as new command categories.
- Make follow-through verifiable: notify, wait, then prove the artifact or task
  is visible to the intended recipient.

## Non-Goals

- No new orchestration preset families.
- No agent management policy engine in the CLI.
- No hidden multi-agent planning beyond the explicit flags in this spec.
- No implementation changes in this document; this is a contract draft only.

## Proposed Flags

### `ax handoff ... --loop`

When a task can be advanced by another agent without human judgment, `--loop`
keeps the feedback loop active:

```bash
ax handoff orion \
  "Fix the failing contract tests. Run pytest. Reply with <promise>TESTS GREEN</promise> only when true." \
  --intent implement \
  --loop \
  --max-rounds 5 \
  --completion-promise "TESTS GREEN"
```

Rules:

1. The instructions must be specific and evidence-based.
2. `--max-rounds` is required as the safety cap, even when a completion promise
   is present.
3. `--completion-promise` stops the loop only when a reply contains the exact
   `<promise>TEXT</promise>` value or the exact text as its own line.
4. Timeout means unknown or blocked delivery, not task failure.
5. If the next step requires human judgment, the loop should stop and report the
   decision needed.

`--loop` is not a replacement for product design judgment or production
incident debugging. It is for bounded iteration where validation output, files,
commits, context keys, or a blocker report can prove progress.

Loop target agents should reply when a round is complete or blocked. Progress
chatter consumes loop rounds without adding a useful decision point.

### `ax handoff` adaptive wait

Adaptive wait is the default because the safe path should not depend on the
operator remembering a flag. The CLI probes before deciding whether to wait:

```bash
ax handoff cli_sentinel "Review CLI docs"
ax handoff orion "Known-live fast path" --no-adaptive-wait
```

Behavior:

1. Send a contact-mode ping to the target.
2. If the target replies, continue with the normal wait/loop behavior.
3. If the target does not reply, create the task and send the message, but do
   not wait on a channel that is not proven live.
4. Return `status=queued_not_listening` with the contact probe details.

This keeps shared state durable even when live delivery is unavailable: the task
and message exist for later pickup, and the CLI reports that it queued the work
instead of presenting timeout as an agent decision.

User-facing surfaces must preserve the distinction:

- `contact_mode=event_listener` means a live listener was confirmed and the CLI
  is waiting for a response.
- `status=queued_not_listening` means work was saved to shared state, but no
  live listener was confirmed.

Do not collapse both states into a generic `Queued` or `Waiting for @agent`
label. That recreates black-hole ambiguity at the UI layer.

### `--notify [@agent] ["optional message"]`

After the primary command succeeds, send a message containing:

1. the user-provided optional message, if present
2. the relevant metadata for the command that just completed
3. a compact natural-language summary of what happened

The flag may appear in three forms:

```bash
--notify
--notify @agent
--notify @agent "optional message"
```

If `@agent` is omitted, the CLI should use the command's existing assignee or
recipient when one exists. If no implicit target exists, the CLI must fail with
an actionable error that tells the user to supply `@agent`.

### `--wait`

Block after the notify step until a matching response arrives or a timeout is
reached. `--wait` is only valid when notification is active, either explicitly
(`--notify`) or implicitly via a command contract that includes notification.

Under the hood, this should reuse the watch machinery rather than create a new
transport path.

### `--assign @agent`

Available on task creation/update flows that set task ownership. The CLI should
resolve the agent handle to the canonical agent UUID before making the task API
call, then include the resolved owner in both output and any notify payload.

## Command Coverage

### Phase 1

The first spec pass should cover the commands users already chain manually most
often:

- `ax context set ...`
- `ax upload file ...`
- `ax task create ...`
- `ax task update ...` (optional if owner changes are supported)

### Explicitly Out of Scope for This Spec Draft

- Broad retrofitting of every command in the CLI.
- Reworking unrelated convenience commands.
- Prescribing notification behavior for read-only commands.

## Metadata Forwarding Contract

The notify payload must include the command-specific durable pointer set. The
message body can be human-friendly, but the forwarded data must be predictable.

### `ax context set <key> <value> --notify ...`

Include:

- `context_key`
- resolved `space_id`
- value type / storage mode when available
- any returned URL or retrieval hint if the backend provides one

Example message shape:

```text
@cipher auth spec ready for review
Context key: spec:auth
Space: 49afd277-...
```

### `ax upload file <path> --notify ...`

Include:

- upload id
- filename
- content type
- size bytes
- file URL
- linked context key, if one was created
- resolved `space_id`

### `ax task create "title" --assign @agent --notify ...`

Include:

- task id
- title
- owner agent name
- owner agent id
- priority / status when available
- file URL or context key if the task references one
- resolved `space_id`

## Skill / Behavior Contract

The CLI provides the primitives and flags. The `ax-operator` skill provides the
operating discipline.

Agents should learn this default loop from the skill. Prefer a composed command
such as `ax handoff` when the flow involves task ownership plus a reply:

1. verify identity and target environment
2. create or track the task/artifact
3. notify the relevant agent or requester with durable metadata
4. wait on SSE/watch for the reply when a response is expected
5. extract the reply signal, ranking, evidence, or blocker
6. execute the next step
7. report back with commit, diff, validation, or artifact proof
8. wait again when follow-up is expected

The proof step is not optional for agent handoffs. A command that reports
success locally is not enough if the target agent cannot discover the artifact.
This protects the platform from silent upload, context, and task handoff
failures.

A sent message is not completion. Completion requires an observed reply, an
explicit timeout, or a deliberately fire-and-forget notification.

The skill should teach the flag-based form once implemented, while documenting
the current manual fallback during the transition:

```bash
ax upload file ./screenshot.png --notify @frontend_sentinel "UI regression"
ax messages get <notification-message-id> --json
```

Until `--notify` and `--wait` are implemented, agents must perform the same
steps manually with `ax send`, `ax watch`, and explicit result fetches.
For task-backed delegation, `ax handoff` is the preferred current composed
fallback because it already bundles task creation, targeted send, watch,
recent-message fallback, and structured output.

## Wait Contract

`--wait` should behave like a high-level shortcut around `ax watch`.

Minimum contract:

1. Primary command succeeds.
2. Notify message is sent.
3. CLI watches for a response from the notified agent.
4. On match, CLI prints both the original command result and the matching
   response payload.
5. On timeout, CLI exits non-zero with a clear timeout message.

### Matching Rules

Initial matching should be conservative and explicit:

- prefer replies to the notification message/thread when available
- otherwise match messages from the notified agent after the notify timestamp
- honor existing `space_id` resolution

## Output Contract

### Human Output

Human-readable mode should show a stepwise summary:

```text
✓ Context updated: spec:auth
✓ Notified @cipher
… Waiting for @cipher
✓ Reply received
```

### JSON Output

JSON mode should preserve the primary command result and workflow metadata in a
stable envelope:

```json
{
  "command": "context set",
  "primary_result": {
    "context_key": "spec:auth"
  },
  "workflow": {
    "notified": true,
    "notified_agent": {
      "handle": "@cipher",
      "id": "uuid"
    },
    "notification_message_id": "uuid",
    "waited": true,
    "reply": {
      "message_id": "uuid",
      "content": "reviewing now"
    }
  }
}
```

## Error Handling

The workflow flags must fail at the right layer.

- If the primary command fails, no notify step runs.
- If agent resolution fails for `--assign`, the task is not created.
- If the primary command succeeds but notify fails, return the primary result
  plus an explicit notification failure.
- If notify succeeds but wait times out, return the primary result and notify
  result, then exit with timeout status.
- `--wait` without active notification must fail fast with a usage error.

## Examples

### Context handoff

```bash
ax context set spec:auth ./spec.md --notify @cipher "auth spec ready for review"
```

Expected flow:
1. Store context under `spec:auth`
2. Send message to `@cipher`
3. Auto-include `context_key=spec:auth`

### File upload handoff

```bash
ax upload file ./screenshot.png --notify @cipher "bug screenshot attached"
```

Expected flow:
1. Upload file
2. Notify `@cipher`
3. Auto-include attachment metadata and URL

### Task delegation + wait

```bash
ax task create "Run smoke tests" --assign @orion --notify --wait
```

Expected flow:
1. Create task with owner resolved to `@orion`
2. Notify `@orion` with task id + owner metadata
3. Wait for response using the watch pipeline

## Documentation Plan

This proposal should land as either:

1. a standalone workflow spec (`CLI-WORKFLOW-001`) plus a command-reference
   update in `CLI-DOCS-007`, or
2. a dedicated workflow section inside `CLI-DOCS-007` if the command reference
   is already the active source of truth.

Recommendation: keep this as a standalone spec first, then fold the final flag
syntax into `CLI-DOCS-007` once implementation details are settled.

## Migration Guidance for Docs

Documentation should stop teaching `assign`, `ship`, `manage`, and `boss` as
first-class workflow verbs.

Replace that material with a "Workflows" page built from compositions such as:

- create task + assign + notify
- upload file + notify
- set context + notify + wait
- create task + assign + notify + wait

If legacy verbs remain temporarily in the CLI, mark them as transitional and
scheduled for removal once the flag-based workflow surface ships.

## Open Questions

- Final argument parsing shape for `--notify`: one option with optional values,
  or split flags such as `--notify`, `--notify-agent`, `--message` under the
  hood while documenting a friendlier shorthand?
- Whether `--wait` needs a dedicated timeout flag on every command or should
  inherit an existing global workflow timeout.
- Whether notify messages should always thread off the created artifact when the
  command can produce a parent/message anchor.

## Resolved: File Upload Collaboration Path

`ax upload file` is the canonical collaboration command for sharing a file as a
context event. It uploads bytes, stores a context pointer, and sends one compact
message signal by default.

`ax send --file` is the canonical message-attachment path when the user starts
from chat and wants the file to appear as a polished inline preview. It should
still include context metadata so agents can load the artifact later.

`ax context upload-file` remains a lower-level storage-only primitive for
scripts and backing-store writes. It should not be the path taught to users or
agents when the goal is "share this artifact with the team."
